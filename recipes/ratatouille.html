                <li>
                    2 large aubergines
                </li>

                <li>
                    5 tbsp olive oil

                <li>
                    1 medium onion, peeled and thinly sliced
                </li>
                <li>
                    3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 tbsp red wine vinegar
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 tsp sugar (any kind)

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cut 2 large aubergines in half lengthways. Place them on the board, cut side down, slice in half
                    lengthways
                    again and then across into 1.5cm chunks. Cut the ends off 4 small courgettes, then across into 1.5cm
                    slices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Peel 2 red or yellow peppers from stalk to bottom. Hold upright, cut around the stalk, then cut into
                    3
                    pieces. Cut away any membrane, then chop into bite-size chunks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Score a small cross on the base of each of 4 large ripe tomatoes, then put them into a heatproof
                    bowl.
                    Pour
                    boiling water over, leave for 20 secs, then remove. Pour the water away, replace the tomatoes and
                    cover
                    with
                    cold water. Leave to cool, then peel the skin away.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quarter the tomatoes, scrape away the seeds with a spoon, then roughly chop the flesh.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set a sauté pan over medium heat and when hot, pour in 2 tbsp olive oil. Brown the aubergines for 5
                    mins
                    on
                    each side until the pieces are soft. Set them aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fry the courgettes in another tbsp oil for 5 mins, until golden on both sides. Repeat with the
                    peppers.
                    Don’t overcook the vegetables at this stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tear up the leaves from the bunch of basil and set aside. Cook 1 thinly sliced medium onion in the
                    pan
                    for 5
                    minutes. Add 3 crushed garlic cloves and fry for a further minute. Stir in 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
                    and 1
                    tsp
                    sugar, then tip in the tomatoes and half the basil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return the vegetables to the pan with some salt and pepper and cook for 5 mins. Serve with basil.
