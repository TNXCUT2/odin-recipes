                    <li>
                        nutmeg, for grating

                        a squeeze of lemon juice

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        To make the pasta, put the flour in a bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the eggs and
                        egg
                        yolks and mix
                        with a fork, bringing more of the flour in from the sides as you mix. Once the mixture comes
                        together into a
                        ball, tip it out onto a work surface and knead for 10-15 mins until firm and smooth. Wrap
                        and
                        leave to rest
                        for 30 mins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the
                        garlic
                        for 30
                        seconds. Add the spinach with a few tablespoons of water, and cook until the spinach has
                        wilted
                        and is dark
                        green and the water has evaporated. Stir in the lemon zest, grate over some nutmeg and
                        season.
                        Tip the
                        mixture into a bowl and leave to cool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cut the pasta dough into four pieces so it’s easier to work with. Run one piece through a
                        pasta
                        machine
                        (leaving the remaining pieces covered to prevent them drying out), starting with the widest
                        setting and
                        working down to the thinnest setting. Keep the machine and the pasta well floured to prevent
                        sticking or
                        tearing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix the ricotta into the spinach mixture and season well. Do this just before you’re ready
                        to
                        fill the
                        pasta, or chill until needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To make the ravioli, cut a sheet of pasta in half so you have two equal lengths. Lay out on
                        a
                        well-floured
                        work surface, then spoon heaped teaspoons of the filling, spaced 5cm apart, over one of the
                        pasta sheets.
                        Brush the exposed pasta around the filling with water. Gently lift the second pasta sheet
                        over
                        the fillings,
                        and use the side of your hand to press the pasta sheets together around the fillings to
                        seal,
                        ensuring there
                        are no air bubbles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stamp out the ravioli using a round cutter (position it so the filling is in the centre of
                        the
                        circle), or
                        use a sharp knife to cut out square ravioli. Arrange in a single layer over baking trays
                        dusted
                        with flour,
                        then repeat the process with the remaining pasta dough pieces. Will keep, covered and
                        chilled,
                        for up to two
                        days.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To cook, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and gently lower in the ravioli using
                        a
                        slotted
                        spoon. Boil for 2-3 mins until the pasta is cooked through, then remove to a bowl using a
                        slotted spoon.
                        (You may need to cook the ravioli in batches to ensure it's evenly cooked.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, drop in the sage and fry
                        until
                        the butter
                        turns a nutty brown and the sage leaves are crisp. Remove from the heat and toss in the
                        ravioli.
                        Sprinkle
                        with parmesan and some lemon juice, then season with cracked black pepper and toss gently in
                        the
                        butter to
                        coat. Divide between warm bowls and sprinkle with more parmesan before serving.
